This project is a recreation of pong that allows for cross device connection using the Winsock API in C++. Furthermore is project uses a framework with OpenGL. AS part of this project I was responsible for Core Gameplay of Pong and allowing for messaging to be sent. I handled the packaging and sending of data.
